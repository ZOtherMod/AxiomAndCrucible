# OVERCLOCKING & MALFUNCTIONS

In _Axiom & Crucible_, weapons are machines operating near their tolerance limits.  
You may push them harder — but machines always push back.

## OVERCLOCKING (VOLUNTARY)

### What Is Overclocking?

**Overclocking** is the act of deliberately driving a weapon beyond its safe operating parameters to increase output.

Overclocking is declared **before** rolling.

---

### Base Weapon Profile

Every weapon has:

- **Difficulty** (Target Number)
    
- **Damage**
    
- **Instability** (Passive instability gain per use, generally 0)
    
- **Instability Gauge** (max instability)
Example weapon:

- Difficulty: **10**
    
- Damage: **2d6**
    
- Instability: **0**
    
- Instability Gauge: 3

---

### Single Overclock

Each time you overclock a weapon, it'll receive additional stats at the cost of increased difficulty and potential backlashes. For example, the overclock stats on the example weapon is:

- **+2 Difficulty**
    
- **+1 Instability**
    
- **+1d4 Damage**
    

So the example weapon becomes:

- Difficulty: **12**
    
- Damage: **2d6 + 1d4**
    
- Instability: **1**
    

---

### Multiple Overclocks

You may overclock **multiple times in a single action**.

Each overclock stacks fully.

Example (3 Overclocks):

- Difficulty: **16**
    
- Damage: **2d6 + 3d4**
    
- Instability: **3**
    

There is **no hard limit** on overclocking — only consequences.

---

## INSTABILITY GAUGE

Instability represents accumulated stress, heat, vibration, and tolerance drift within the weapon.

Each weapon tracks its own **Instability Gauge**.

- Instability persists between actions
    
- Instability resets only through cooldowns, repairs, or modules
    

---

## FORCE & INSTABILITY

Your **Force** stat determines how much instability you can safely tolerate.

- Each point of **Force increases your safe Instability threshold by 1**
    

If your weapon’s Instability **exceeds your Force**, the weapon becomes unstable.

This does **not** stop you from firing.

It changes what failure looks like.

---

## MALFUNCTION STATES

Instability does nothing by itself — it only matters **when you fail a roll**.

When you fail a weapon roll, check the weapon’s current Instability.

### Instability ≤ Instabilit gauge

- Minor fault
    
- Reduced damage, momentary loss of control, or warning signs
    

### Instability > Instability gauge

- Major malfunction
    
- Jam, feedback injury, component damage, or uncontrolled discharge
    

### Instability ≥ Double the Instability gauge

- Catastrophic failure
    
- Structural damage, explosions, or cascading system collapse
    

(Exact effects are defined by weapon traits and modules.)

---

## IMPORTANT DESIGN RULES

- Overclocking increases **difficulty**, not damage rolls
    
- Force does not reduce difficulty
    
- Force increases how much danger you can tolerate
    
- Instability belongs to the weapon, not the player
    

---

## WHY MODULES MATTER

Engineering solutions mitigate instability, not skill.

Examples:

- Heat dissipation modules
    
- Reinforced housings
    
- Vibration dampeners
    
- Emergency cutoff regulators
    

A character with low Force can still survive high-output weapons — if the machine is well-designed.

## PLAYER GUIDANCE

> Overclocking is never free.  
> If you push the machine, prepare to manage the fallout.

Safe play is restraint.  
Effective play is controlled risk.
