# PLAYER STATS & USING WEAPONS

This section explains how **your character’s abilities** interact with weapons and devices.

In _Axiom & Crucible_, weapons are machines. They do not become stronger because you are heroic. They become **safer, more precise, and more controllable** in skilled hands.

## THE FIVE CORE STATS

Your character has five core stats. Each answers a practical question.

### **Cognition — “Do you understand the system?”**

**Domain:** Knowledge & prediction  
**Failure Type:** Hidden faults get worse

- Identifies problems early
    
- Predicts cascading failures
    
- Reduces _unknown_ risks
    
(mechanically right now I envision this as "I use cognition to see if this'll have any consequences", *rolls dice* "It's a low roll , I'll not do that action.")
> Cognition acts **before** failure.

---

### **Precision — “Can you control it exactly?”**

**Domain:** Accuracy & fine control  
**Failure Type:** Misalignment, stray force

- Affects targeting and delicate operation
    
- Determines where output goes
    
(Adds to your roll for stuff.)
> Precision affects **intent vs execution**.

---

### **Force — “How much output can you physically channel?”**

**Domain:** Load tolerance  
**Failure Type:** Recoil, backlash, overstrain

- Sets safe Instability threshold
    
- Governs overclock tolerance
    
- Never mitigates consequences after failure
    
(Instability Gauge)
> Force governs **how far you can push**.

---

### **Resilience — “How badly does failure hurt you?”**

**Domain:** Damage conversion  
**Failure Type:** Injury escalation

- Converts Injury → Strain
    
- Reduces escalation severity
    
- Never prevents failure
    
()
> Resilience governs **damage severity**, not survival chance.

---

### **Adaptation — “Can you recover in the moment?”**

**Domain:** Real-time response  
**Failure Type:** Failure persistence

- Clears jams
    
- Stabilizes systems mid-failure
    
- Reduces _duration_ of bad states
    

> Adaptation governs **recovery**, not prevention.

## USING WEAPONS

When you use a weapon, you roll:

**1d20 + relevant stat**

The stat depends on what you are doing:

- Aiming → Precision
    
- Powering or bracing → Force
    
- Diagnosing behavior → Cognition
    
- Recovering from failure → Adaptation
    

You do **not** add damage from your stats.

---

## WEAPON OUTPUT & LIMITS

Every weapon has an **Output Rating**.

If a weapon’s Output is **higher than your Force**, you may still use it — but:

- Each use generates additional stress
    
- Failures escalate faster
    
- You risk injuring yourself
    

High power without sufficient Force is reckless.

---

## FAILURE & YOU

When something goes wrong, your stats determine what happens next.

- Misfires → Precision
    
- Jams → Adaptation
    
- Overheating → Resilience
    
- Structural faults → Cognition
    
- Recoil or backlash → Force
    

Failure is not “you miss.” Failure is **something breaks — now react**.

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLES (FOR PLAYERS)

- Weapons are dangerous tools, not extensions of your body
    
- Skill improves control, not damage
    
- Safety and restraint matter
    
- Failure is expected and survivable
    

You are not a warrior. You are an operator.
