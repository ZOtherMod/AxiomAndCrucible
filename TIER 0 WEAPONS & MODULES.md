# TIER 0 WEAPONS & MODULES

Tier 0 represents **baseline engineering**: simple platforms enhanced by a single, defining module.

At this tier, weapons do not win by raw damage. They win by **control, reliability, or escalation discipline**.

At character creation, each player chooses:

1. **One Base Weapon Platform**
    
2. **One Tier 0 Module**
    

No stacking. No prerequisites. One rule change per weapon.

## CORE COMBAT ASSUMPTIONS

- Base Damage: **1d6**
    
- Base Difficulty: **10**
    
- Base Instability: **0**
    
- Damage is converted to Severity, not subtracted from HP

# BASE WEAPON PLATFORMS

Platforms define **range, engagement rules, and inherent advantages**.  
They do not grant traits.

---

## RANGED PLATFORM

**Range:** Medium  
**Engagement Penalty:**

- Attacks against Engaged targets: +2 Difficulty
    
- Cannot Critically Succeed against Engaged targets
    

**Mobility Constraint:**

- Move + Attack in the same turn: +1 Difficulty
    

**Role:** Safe pressure, positioning, sustained fire

---

## MELEE PLATFORM

**Range:** Engaged

**Close Control (Passive):**

- On a Clean Success, choose one:
    
    - Reduce target Instability by 1
        
    - Increase target Instability by 1
        

**Opportunity Pressure:**

- If a target disengages without spending an action, you may make a free attack at +2 Difficulty
    

**Role:** Control, disruption, decisive engagement

# TIER 0 MODULES

Modules change **how the weapon behaves**, not how hard it hits.
