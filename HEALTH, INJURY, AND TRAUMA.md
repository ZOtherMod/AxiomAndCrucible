# HEALTH, INJURY, AND TRAUMA

In _Axiom & Crucible_, health is not a number you lose.  
It is a record of what has gone wrong.

Characters are not worn down by combat — they are **compromised by failure**.

---

## DESIGN PRINCIPLE

Health exists to answer one question:

> _When the system fails, what happens to the operator?_

Health tracks are:

- Discrete, not continuous
    
- Consequence-based, not subtractive
    
- Persistent, not forgettable
    

---

## THE THREE CONDITION TRACKS

Every character has three condition tracks:

1. **Strain** – Short-term overload
    
2. **Injury** – Lasting physical harm
    
3. **Trauma** – Permanent or life-altering damage
    

Each track represents a deeper layer of failure.

---

# STRAIN

Strain represents short-term overload and clears quickly, but if allowed to accumulate unchecked, it will convert into lasting damage.

### STRAIN CAPACITY

Maximum Strain:

**6 + Resilience**

---

### GAINING STRAIN

You gain Strain when:

- You suffer recoil or backlash
    
- A weapon malfunctions at low Instability
    
- You are hit by glancing or controlled attacks
    
- You overclock and narrowly fail
    

Strain is common and expected.

---

### EFFECTS OF STRAIN

- Strain has no immediate penalties
    
- Strain fills before Injury
    

If you would gain Strain while at maximum Strain:

- Convert 1 Strain into **1 Injury**
    

---

### RECOVERING STRAIN

Strain clears:

- At the end of a scene
    
- After rest or cooldown
    
- Via medical attention or modules
    

---

# INJURY

Injury represents burns, fractures, lacerations, and internal damage.

Injury changes how you operate.

---

### INJURY CAPACITY

Maximum Injuries:

**2 + ⌊Resilience / 2⌋**

---

### GAINING INJURY

You gain Injury when:

- Strain overflows
    
- You suffer a major malfunction
    
- You take a heavy or uncontrolled hit
    
- Instability exceeds Force during failure
    

---

### INJURY EFFECTS

Each Injury:

- Applies a specific penalty
    
- Is narratively described
    
- Does not stack generic modifiers
    

Examples:

- Burned Arm → +2 Difficulty on Precision actions
    
- Cracked Ribs → −1 Force while overclocking
    
- Concussion → −1 Cognition until treated
    

---

### RECOVERING INJURY

Injury clears:

- With time
    
- With proper medical care
    
- Through repair, surgery, or augmentation
    

Injuries do not clear during combat.

---

# TRAUMA

Trauma represents catastrophic bodily or neurological damage.

Trauma permanently changes the character.

---

### TRAUMA CAPACITY

Characters have **2 Trauma slots** by default.

---

### GAINING TRAUMA

You gain Trauma when:

- You suffer a catastrophic malfunction
    
- You would gain Injury while at maximum Injuries
    
- You are exposed to extreme feedback or explosion
    

---

### TRAUMA EFFECTS

Each Trauma:

- Permanently alters the character
    
- May disable stats, limbs, or senses
    
- Often requires augmentation or retirement
    

Examples:

- Nerve destruction → Precision permanently capped
    
- Organ failure → Reduced Resilience
    
- Neural scarring → Unstable Cognition
    

---

### DEATH

If you would gain Trauma and all Trauma slots are filled:

**The character dies.**

Death is never sudden.  
It is the result of ignored warning signs.

---

# ARMOR & PROTECTION

Armor does not absorb damage.

Instead, armor:

- Converts Injury → Strain
    
- Converts Trauma → Injury
    
- May add Instability to incoming attacks
    

Armor protects the operator — not the system.

---

# STAT INTERACTION SUMMARY

- **Resilience** increases Strain and Injury capacity
    
- **Force** determines Instability tolerance
    
- **Adaptation** clears or stabilizes failures
    
- **Precision** prevents misapplication of force
    
- **Cognition** prevents unseen escalation
    

No stat negates consequences.

---

# DAMAGE & IMPACT SEVERITY

Weapons still roll damage as normal. Damage is not subtracted from a pool.  
Instead, damage determines **how severe the hit is**.

---

## DAMAGE → SEVERITY

After rolling damage, convert the total into a **Severity Tier**:

|Damage Total|Severity|
|---|---|
|1–3|Negligible|
|4–6|Light|
|7–9|Heavy|
|10–12|Severe|
|13+|Catastrophic|

Severity reflects penetration, energy transfer, and bodily shock.

---

## SEVERITY → CONDITIONS

Severity determines which condition track is affected:

| Severity     | Condition Gained              |
| ------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Negligible   | No condition (narrative only) |
| Light        | +1 Strain                     |
| Heavy        | +2 Strain                     |
| Severe       | +1 Injury and +1 Strain       |
| Catastrophic | +1 Trauma                     |

---

## CONVERSIONS & MITIGATION

Before applying conditions, apply any conversions from:

- Armor
    
- Shields
    
- Cover
    
- Modules
    
- Traits
    

Typical conversions include:

- Injury → Strain
    
- Trauma → Injury
    
- Reduce Severity by 1 tier
    

After conversions, apply conditions normally.

---

## OVERFLOW

If a condition track is full:

- Strain overflow → Injury
    
- Injury overflow → Trauma
    
- Trauma overflow → Death
    

---

# DESIGN INTENT

Damage answers **how bad**.  
Health determines **what happens**.

> You do not lose health.  
> You accumulate evidence of failure.
