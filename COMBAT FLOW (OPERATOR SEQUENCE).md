# COMBAT FLOW (OPERATOR SEQUENCE)

This section describes the **exact order of operations** when using weapons in combat. Follow it top to bottom. If a step is skipped, the machine behaves unpredictably.

---

## STEP 1: DECLARE INTENT

State **what you are trying to do**, not the numbers.

Examples:

- “I fire a controlled shot.”
    
- “I suppress the area.”
    
- “I overload the emitter and punch through the armor.”
    

Intent determines:

- Which stat applies
    
- Which traits are relevant
    

---

## STEP 2: SET BASE PROFILE

Write down the weapon’s base values:

- Difficulty
    
- Damage
    
- Current Instability
    

No modifiers yet.

---

## STEP 3: DECLARE OVERCLOCKING

Choose how many times you overclock **before rolling**.

For each overclock:

- +2 Difficulty
    
- +1 Instability
    
- +1d4 Damage
    

Mark Instability immediately.

Once declared, overclocks cannot be reduced.

---

## STEP 4: APPLY TRAITS & MODULES

Apply weapon traits in this strict order:

1. **Die Shape Traits** (Stable, Chaotic, etc.)
    
2. **Failure-Bias Traits** (Forgiving, Brittle, etc.)
    
3. **Control Traits** (Tunable, Buffered, etc.)
    

If multiple traits conflict, the weapon behaves unpredictably (GM decides the worse interpretation).

---

## STEP 5: CHECK FORCE VS INSTABILITY

Compare current Instability to your Force:

- Instability ≤ Force → Weapon is strained
    
- Instability > Force → Weapon is unstable
    
- Instability ≥ Force + 3 → Weapon is critical
    

This does not stop the roll. It determines how failure is interpreted.

---

## STEP 6: ROLL

Roll:

**d20 (or replaced die) + relevant stat**

Compare the result to the final Difficulty.

---

## STEP 7: INTERPRET RESULT

- Success → Apply damage and effects
    
- Failure → Check Instability state
    

Do not skip this step. Failure always produces fiction.

---

## STEP 8: RESOLVE FAILURE OR EFFECTS

If successful:

- Deal damage
    
- Apply weapon effects
    

If failed:

- Minor fault (strained)
    
- Major malfunction (unstable)
    
- Catastrophic failure (critical)
    

Apply:

- Conditions
    
- Weapon damage
    
- Environmental consequences
    

---

## STEP 9: RECOVERY OPTIONS

If a malfunction occurred, you may:

- Use Adaptation to clear jams
    
- Shut down the weapon
    
- Continue operating at risk
    

Recovery never removes Instability unless stated.

---

## STEP 10: END STATE UPDATE

Update:

- Weapon Instability
    
- Character Conditions
    
- Ammo / charge state



### RESULT BANDS & MARGINS

When you roll, compare your result to the final Difficulty.

|Margin|Outcome|
|---|---|
|Success by 5+|Critical Success|
|Success|Clean Success|
|Fail by 1–4|Partial Failure|
|Fail by 5+|Hard Failure|

---

#### Critical Success

- Increase damage Severity by **1 tier**
    
- Reduce weapon Instability by **1**
    
- The system performs above tolerance
    

---

#### Clean Success

- Deal damage normally
    
- No additional effects
    

---

#### Partial Failure

- Reduced or no damage
    
- Instability effects still apply
    
- If damage is dealt, **reduce Severity by 1 tier**
    

Partial failure represents near-misses, glancing blows, or incomplete energy transfer.

---

#### Hard Failure

- No damage
    
- Malfunction escalates based on current Instability state
    
- The system fails decisively
