## Tier‑0 Engineering & Logic Module Compendium

This document defines the **complete starting (Tier‑0) Engineering and Logic module set** available to all characters at game start. These modules represent _pre‑industrial, apprentice‑level technology_ operating at the edge of magical science.

They are intentionally **inefficient, unstable, and limited**, designed to teach players how systems fail.

---

## GLOBAL TIER‑0 CONSTRAINTS

All Tier‑0 Engineering & Logic modules obey the following rules:

- **Stability Threshold Contribution:** +0 to +2
    
- **Power Throughput:** Low
    
- **Stress Tolerance:** Limited
    
- **Maintenance Requirement:** Frequent
    
- **Overclocking:** Allowed (+2 Instability per use)
    
- **Material Quality:** Crude or reclaimed
    

---

## MODULE STAT FORMAT (SIMPLIFIED)

To reduce cognitive load, all modules now use a **layered, color-coded mental model**. Players never need to understand every stat at once.

Each module belongs to **exactly one Layer**, which defines _how_ it behaves.

### Core Fields (Always Visible)

- **Role** – What job this module performs
    
- **Layer** – Structural, Power, Control, Sense, or Safety
    
- **Slots Used** – How many mount points it occupies
    
- **Risk** – How dangerous it is (Low / Medium / High)
    

### Advanced Fields (Only When Relevant)

- Stress, Instability, Accuracy, etc. are only consulted **when that layer is stressed**.

# TIER-0 DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: SHELLS & LAYERS

Tier-0 play uses **Shells + Layer Cards** instead of freeform modular construction.

This preserves system depth while dramatically reducing player-facing complexity.

At Tier-0:

- Players choose **one Shell** (what kind of thing this is)
    
- Players slot **Layer Cards** into that Shell
    
- Each Layer is represented by **exactly one card**
    

At higher tiers, Shell restrictions are gradually removed, transitioning into full modular construction.

---

## WHAT IS A SHELL?

A **Shell** defines the _physical and conceptual category_ of a device.

A Shell determines:

- Mandatory Layers
    
- Optional Layers
    
- Slot count
    
- Stress limits
    
- Allowed behaviors
    

Players never design from scratch at Tier-0 — they _populate a known shape_.

---

## WHAT IS A LAYER CARD?

A **Layer Card** is a simplified representation of a module layer.

Each Layer Card shows only:

- Role (plain language)
    
- Risk Level
    
- Slot Cost
    
- One Failure Trigger
    

Full stats remain hidden unless failure occurs.

# SECTION I: TIER-0 SHELLS

Shells are selected **before** choosing any layer cards.

---

## Shell A: Hand Tool

**Concept:** A manually operated device held by a person.

**Mandatory Layers:**

- Structure
    
- Power
    

**Optional Layers:**

- Control
    
- Safety
    

**Slot Capacity:** 2

**Stress Limit:** Low

**Special Rule:** If Stress exceeds limit, the operator suffers consequences.

---

## Shell B: Static Device

**Concept:** A stationary mechanism (trap, press, generator).

**Mandatory Layers:**

- Structure
    
- Power
    

**Optional Layers:**

- Control
    
- Sense
    
- Safety
    

**Slot Capacity:** 3

**Stress Limit:** Moderate

---

## Shell C: Simple Automaton

**Concept:** A slow, semi-autonomous machine.

**Mandatory Layers:**

- Structure
    
- Power
    
- Control
    

**Optional Layers:**

- Sense
    
- Safety
    

**Slot Capacity:** 3

**Stress Limit:** Low

**Special Rule:** Control failures cause erratic behavior.

---

# SECTION II: TIER-0 LAYER CARDS (PLAYER HANDBOOK)

This section is written **for players**.

At Tier-0, you do not build machines piece by piece.  
You assemble them by choosing **Layer Cards** and placing them into a **Shell**.

Each layer answers **one simple question**.  
If you can answer the question, the machine works.

You may only take **one card per layer** at Tier-0.

---

## STRUCTURE LAYER – “What holds this together?”

### Structure Card: Basic Frame

**You take this if:** you want the machine to physically exist.

- **Role:** Holds all other layers together
    
- **Risk:** Low
    
- **Slots Used:** 0 (provided by the Shell)
    

**When it fails:**

- The device bends, cracks, or collapses
    
- Any further use risks total destruction
    

---

## POWER LAYER – “What makes this do anything?”

### Power Card: Manual Drive

**You take this if:** you want direct, reliable power at the cost of effort.

- **Role:** Converts your effort into motion or force
    
- **Risk:** Low
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- The device locks up or kicks back
    
- You may be injured or exhausted
    

---

### Power Card: Stored Motion

**You take this if:** you want short bursts of power without constant effort.

- **Role:** Releases stored kinetic force
    
- **Risk:** Medium
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- Power releases all at once
    
- Nearby creatures or structures take damage
    

---

## CONTROL LAYER – “How does it decide what to do?”

### Control Card: Simple Trigger

**You take this if:** the device should act when something specific happens.

- **Role:** On/Off behavior based on one condition
    
- **Risk:** Low
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- The trigger sticks or misfires
    
- The device activates at the wrong time
    

---

### Control Card: Fixed Sequence

**You take this if:** the device should perform a short, repeatable routine.

- **Role:** Executes a set series of actions
    
- **Risk:** Medium
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- Steps occur out of order
    
- The device may repeat or skip actions
    

---

## SENSE LAYER – “What can this detect?”

### Sense Card: Physical Contact

**You take this if:** the device should react to touch or obstruction.

- **Role:** Detects direct contact

- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- Missed contact or constant false signals
    

---

### Sense Card: Stress & Motion

**You take this if:** the device should react to strain or vibration.

- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- Overreaction or total silence
    

---

## SAFETY LAYER – “What prevents disaster?”

### Safety Card: Emergency Release

**You take this if:** you want the machine to fail safely.

- **Role:** Reduces damage when something goes wrong
    
- **Risk:** Low
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- The release jams or works only partially
    

---

### Safety Card: Shock Dampening

**You take this if:** the device will experience sudden impacts.

- **Role:** Absorbs violent force
    
- **Risk:** Low
    
- **Slots Used:** 1
    

**When it fails:**

- Protection degrades or stops working

# HOW TO BUILD A TIER-0 DEVICE (QUICK GUIDE)

1. Choose a **Shell**
    
2. Take all **mandatory layers**
    
3. Add optional Layer Cards up to slot limit
    
4. Describe what it does in plain language
    
5. Use it — and deal with the consequences
    

If your machine answers all its layer questions, it works.

---

# IMPORTANT THINGS TO REMEMBER

- Tier-0 machines are **not safe**
    
- Failure teaches you how the system works
    
- Adding Safety makes machines weaker but survivable
    
- Later tiers replace cards with full modules
    

This is only the beginning.
